# Volun
## What it does
Volun provides users with a personalized experience by using a login/register page. Users can track their volunteer hours, and get badges after reaching a certain number of volunteer hours. This encourages people to volunteer. Volun also has a button that takes users to VolunteerMatch to find many nearby volunteer opportunities.

## How I built it
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Challenges I ran into
Making the login page was difficult. I had to learn more JavaScript to make it.

## What I learned
This project improved my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills.

## What's next for Volun
Next, I plan to connect Volun with an AI chatbot to answer users' questions about volunteering.
